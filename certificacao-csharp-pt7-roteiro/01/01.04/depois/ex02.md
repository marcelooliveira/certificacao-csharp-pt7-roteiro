You are implementing a method that creates an instance of a class named User. The User\
class contains a public event named Renamed. The following code segment defines the\
Renamed event:\
Public event EventHandler<RenameEventArgs> Renamed;\
You need to create an event handler for the Renamed event by using a lambda expression.\
How should you complete the relevant code? (To answer, drag the appropriate code\
segments to the correct locations in the answer area. Each code segment may be used\
once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or\
scroll to view content.)\
