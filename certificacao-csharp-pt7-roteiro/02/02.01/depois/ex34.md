You are developing an application by using C#. The application includes an array of decimal\
values named loanAmounts. You are developing a LINQ query to return the values from the\
array.\
The query must return decimal values that are evenly divisible by two. The values must be\
sorted from the lowest value to the highest value.\
You need to ensure that the query correctly returns the decimal values.\
How should you complete the relevant code? (To answer, drag the appropriate code\
segments to the correct locations in the answer area. Each code segment may be used\
once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or\
scroll to view content.)\
