You are developing an application. The application calls a method that returns an array of\
integers named customerIds. You define an integer variable named customerIdToRemove\
and assign a value to it. You declare an array named filteredCustomerIds.\
You have the following requirements.\
Remove duplicate integers from the customerIds array.\
Sort the array in order from the highest value to the lowest value.\
Remove the integer value stored in the customerIdToRemove variable from the customerIds\
array.\
You need to create a LINQ query to meet the requirements.\
