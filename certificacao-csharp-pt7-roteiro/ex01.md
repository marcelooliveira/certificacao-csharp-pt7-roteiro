You have a List object that is generated by executing the following code:

Lisz departments = new List(]
{
"Accounting", "Masketing", "Sales", "Manufacturing", "aOrmation Systems", "Training"
};

You have a method that contains the following code (line numbers are included for reference only):

91 private bool GetMatches(List departments, string searchTerm)
92 {
63 var findDepartment = departments.Exists((delegate(string deptName)
e4 { "
65 return deptName.Equals(searchTerm)g
96 }
07 ));
98 return findDepartment;
89 }

You need to alter the method to use a lambda statement.
How should you rewrite lines 03 through 06 of the method?

A. var findDepartment = departments.First(x => x == searchTerm);
B. var findDepartment = departments.Where(x => x == searchTerm);
C. var findDepartment = departments.Exists(x => XJEqualstsearchTerm));
D. var findDepartment = departments.Where[x => XJEqualstsearchTerm));
